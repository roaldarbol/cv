          I currently work on an experimental and computational pipeline to enable real-time behavioural segmentation, focusing on sleep stage segmentation in the jumping spider, Portia fimbriata. This work encompasses data collection methods, including electronics for closed-loop experiments, through data processing and behaviour segmentation.

          In my M.Sc. dissertation project, I investigated whether wood ants relied on visual clues, especially optical flow, to adjust their walking speed. As part of the project, I helped develop a virtual reality trackball system where we could experimentally manipulate the optical flow.

          Working as a research assistant, I helped on a host of projects. From developing an experimental setup for investigating the existence of express reaching movements (akin to express saccades), to pilot experiments aiming to test optimal control theory for perturbation during force application, and conducting experiments on force field adaptation.

          During my B.Sc., I did two projects with Jesper Lundbye. First, I investigated whether motor learning was accompanied by changes in excitability of the M1 cortical region. In the latter, I did a meta-analysis on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with better learning and memory retention by combining genetic data with behavioural data from over 100 participants across multiple motor learning tasks.
